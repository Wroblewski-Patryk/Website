## Production Hardening Build Rules

- Read existing architecture, code, contracts, UI patterns, route/data flow, and tests before editing.
- Use real API, service, database, and validation paths for delivered behavior.
- Do not use placeholders, fake data, mock-only paths, or temporary fixes.
- Implement user-facing work as a vertical slice across UI, logic, API, DB, validation, error handling, and tests when those layers are involved.
- Stop and report if proper implementation is blocked.
- Validate `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` and `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` before calling work complete.
