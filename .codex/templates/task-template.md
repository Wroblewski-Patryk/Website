# Task

## Header
- ID: FEA-XXX
- Title:
- Status: BACKLOG | READY | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | REVIEW | DONE
- Owner: Planner | Product Docs | Backend Builder | Frontend Builder | QA/Test | Security | DB/Migrations | Ops/Release | Review
- Depends on:
- Priority: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3

## Context
Where this work sits in the current project flow and architecture.

## Goal
What must be achieved by this task.

## Constraints
- use existing systems and approved mechanisms
- preserve locale-aware route boundaries and admin/public split
- preserve block-builder and shared admin form contracts
- do not introduce workaround-only paths
- do not duplicate logic

## Definition of Done
- [ ] concrete completion condition 1
- [ ] concrete completion condition 2
- [ ] concrete completion condition 3

## Forbidden
- new systems without approval
- duplicated logic or parallel implementations of the same contract
- temporary bypasses, hacks, or workaround-only paths
- architecture changes without explicit approval

## Validation Evidence
- Tests:
- Manual checks:
- Screenshots/logs:
- High-risk checks:

## Architecture Evidence (required for architecture-impacting tasks)
- Architecture source reviewed:
- Fits approved architecture: yes | no
- Mismatch discovered: yes | no
- Decision required from user: yes | no
- Approval reference if architecture changed:
- Follow-up architecture doc updates:

## UX/UI Evidence (required for UX tasks)
- Design source type: figma | approved_snapshot | stitch_exception | n/a
- Design source reference:
- Stitch used: yes | no
- Existing shared pattern reused:
- New shared pattern introduced: yes | no
- State checks: loading | empty | error | success | n/a
- Responsive checks: desktop | tablet | mobile | n/a
- Accessibility checks:
- Parity evidence:

## Review Checklist (mandatory)
- [ ] Architecture alignment confirmed.
- [ ] Existing systems were reused where applicable.
- [ ] No workaround paths were introduced.
- [ ] No logic duplication was introduced.
- [ ] Definition of Done evidence is attached.
- [ ] Relevant validations were run.
- [ ] Docs or context were updated if repository truth changed.
- [ ] Learning journal was updated if a recurring pitfall was confirmed.

## Notes
Risks, assumptions, links.

## Production-Grade Required Contract

Every task must include these mandatory sections before it can move to `READY` or `IN_PROGRESS`:

- `Goal`
- `Scope` with exact files, modules, routes, APIs, schemas, docs, or runtime surfaces
- `Implementation Plan` with step-by-step execution and validation
- `Acceptance Criteria` with testable conditions
- `Definition of Done` using `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
- `Result Report`

Runtime tasks must be delivered as a vertical slice: UI -> logic -> API -> DB -> validation -> error handling -> test. Partial implementations, mock-only paths, placeholders, fake data, and temporary fixes are forbidden.

## Integration Evidence

- `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` reviewed: yes | no | not applicable
- Real API/service path used: yes | no | not applicable
- Endpoint and client contract match: yes | no | not applicable
- DB schema and migrations verified: yes | no | not applicable
- Loading state verified: yes | no | not applicable
- Error state verified: yes | no | not applicable
- Refresh/restart behavior verified: yes | no | not applicable
- Regression check performed:

## AI Testing Evidence (required for AI features)

- `AI_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md` reviewed: yes | no | not applicable
- Memory consistency scenarios:
- Multi-step context scenarios:
- Adversarial or role-break scenarios:
- Prompt injection checks:
- Data leakage and unauthorized access checks:
- Result:
