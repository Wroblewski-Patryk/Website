# Subagent Orchestration Workflow

## Objective
Standardize safe delegation and parallelization behavior for Featherly CMS work.

## Steps
1. Keep the critical-path implementation local and use `.codex/context/TASK_BOARD.md` as the source of truth.
2. Delegate only independent side tasks such as docs sync, isolated tests, or contained UI/backend slices.
3. Assign clear file ownership, expected output, and required checks to each subagent.
4. Continue local non-overlapping work while subagents run.
5. Integrate outputs, run the relevant validations, and sync project state if repo truth changed.

## Guardrails
- no overlapping write ownership
- no duplicate implementation effort
- no blocking wait loops without reason
- no delegation of unclear or under-specified tasks
- no drift between delegated work and task board status
