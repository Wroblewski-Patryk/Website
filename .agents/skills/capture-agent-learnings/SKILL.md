description: Capture verified project-specific execution learnings in `.codex/context/LEARNING_JOURNAL.md` and approved reusable UX patterns in `docs/ux/design-memory.md`, then apply them immediately. Use when a recurring failure, environment issue, workflow mistake, or reusable UI/UX lesson is discovered.

# Capture Agent Learnings

## Procedure

## Step 1

Confirm the learning is real before logging it.

- Use at least one evidence source: terminal output, reproducible behavior, or
  primary documentation.
- For UI/UX learnings, approved implementation evidence or review approval also
  counts.

## Step 2

Check `.codex/context/LEARNING_JOURNAL.md` for an existing related entry.

- If an entry already exists, improve it instead of duplicating.
- If no entry exists, add a new one using the journal's current structure.
- For reusable design or UX patterns, also check `docs/ux/design-memory.md`.

## Step 3

Record a concise, operational guardrail.

- Include `Context`, `Symptom`, `Root cause`, and `Guardrail`.
- Add one `Preferred pattern` and one `Avoid` pattern.
- Keep entries short and actionable.
- If the learning should guide future UI work, add or update a matching entry
  in `docs/ux/design-memory.md`.

## Step 4

Apply the guardrail immediately in the current task.

- Update commands, scripts, tests, or docs in the same task so the learning
  becomes active behavior.

## Validation

- verify each new entry is backed by evidence
- verify command patterns match the repository shell context
- verify journal content contains no secrets, tokens, or personal data
- verify design-memory entries are reusable, specific, and approval-backed

## Output

- updated `.codex/context/LEARNING_JOURNAL.md`
- updated `docs/ux/design-memory.md` when the learning affects future UX/UI work
- short note in the task summary naming the new guardrail and where it was
  applied
